# Members-Only 

A basic Ruby on Rails application demonstrating knowledge of authentication and utilizing the Devise gem.

* create an account 

* create new posts

* edit or delete their own posts

* see the author of other posts

You don't have to be signed in to read the posts, but you do if you want to see the author's name.
